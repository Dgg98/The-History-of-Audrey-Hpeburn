    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Audrey Hepburn has become one of the most enduring screen icons of the twentieth century. She had magical screen presence, was a shrine to good taste and in her later years became a crusader for children's rights. President George Bush recognized her contributions as an actor and as an ambassador for children's rights with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>
